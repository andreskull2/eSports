## 🚀 About the Project

This project was built during **NLW #9 – eSports**, an online and free event held by Rocketseat between **September 11 and 18, 2022**. Although it was launched some time ago, I used it as a hands-on challenge to **practice foundational HTML and CSS concepts** as part of my current Full Stack training.

The challenge was to create an **interface inspired by the gaming universe**, working as a link aggregator:

- Profile image at the top
- List of favorite games
- Links to favorite streamers
- Footer with social media icons

This page serves as a kind of **personalized gamer portfolio** or digital card for content creators.

> ✨ *"Embark on a mission to reach your next level in programming. Build a brand-new project in the gaming universe, learn new skills and technologies, and boost your career as a dev."*
